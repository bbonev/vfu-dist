   1. how to compile vfu

     run `build' script from vfu base directory
     
     this should compile everything
     
     to compile vfu manually do this:
     
     -- go to `vslib' directory
     -- run `make'
     -- go to `vfu' directory
     -- run `make'
     
     if something goes wrong, check these:

     -- if your `curses.h' file locations is not `/usr/include/ncurses'
        you have to change this in the Makefile.
 
     -- if vslib library is not in the `../vslib' directory you also
        have to change this in the Makefile.

   2. how to install vfu
 
      run `install' script from vfu base directory

   3. how to install vfu manually
 
     -- you have to copy `vfu' in the `/usr/local/bin' or
        `/usr/bin' directory and set mode to 755 `rwxr-xr-x'
        the owner is not significant ( root is also possible ).

     -- there is preliminary man page ( vfu.1 ) which could be
        copied to /usr/man/man1.
 
     -- copy all `rx/rx_*' tools to /usr/local/bin
     -- install Net::FTP perl module if needed.
