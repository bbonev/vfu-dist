most simple way to have VFU to exit to different directory 
is to have this bash function in ~/.profile or similar location:

function vfu() 
  { 
  /usr/local/bin/vfu $*; 
  cd "`cat /tmp/vfu.exit.$USER`";
  rm -f /tmp/vfu.exit.$USER; 
  }

if you do not want this file to be in the system-wide /tmp directory, you can 
change it in ~/.profile or similar location:


export VFU_EXIT=/home/cade/tmp/vfu.exit.tmp 
function vfu() 
  { 
  ~/bin/vfu $*; 
  cd "`cat $VFU_EXIT`";
  rm -f $VFU_EXIT; 
  }
